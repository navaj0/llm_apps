Queries should be as atomic as possible -- they only need to address one part of the user's question. For example, if the user's query is \"what is the color of a basketball?\", your search query should be \"basketball\". Here's another example: if the user's question is \"Who created the first neural network?\", your first query should be \"neural network\". As you can see, these queries are quite short. Think keywords, not phrases. * At any time, you can make a call to the search engine using the following syntax: <search_query>query_word</search_query>. * You'll then get results back in <search_result> tags.\n",

Use this tool if you want to get up-to-date and comprehensive information on a topic to help answer queries. Queries should be as atomic as possible -- they only need to address one part of the user's question. For example, if the user's query is \"what is the color of a basketball?\", your search query should be \"basketball\". Here's another example: if the user's question is \"Who created the first neural network?\", your first query should be \"neural network\". As you can see, these queries are quite short. Think keywords, not phrases. * At any time, you can make a call to the search engine using the following syntax: <search_query>query_word</search_query>. * You'll then get results back in <search_result> tags.\n",

      "Before beginning to research the user's question, first think for a moment inside <scratchpad> tags about what information is necessary for a well-informed answer. If the user's question is complex, you may need to decompose the query into multiple subqueries and execute them individually. Sometimes the search engine will return empty search results, or the search results may not contain the information you need. In such cases, feel free to try again with a different query.\n",

      "After each call to the Search Engine Tool, reflect briefly inside <search_quality></search_quality> tags about whether you now have enough information to answer, or whether more information is needed. If you have all the relevant information, write it in <information></information> tags, WITHOUT actually answering the question. Otherwise, issue a new search.\n",
